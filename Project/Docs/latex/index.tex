This is a command-\/line based image manipulation tool, designed for all UNIX systems. Written in ANSI-\/C (C99+ standard), this tool should be supported by any UNIX system with minimal extra dependency.

The tool is lightweight, fast, and consistent in usage.

The sections below outline \mbox{\hyperlink{index_install_sec}{Installation}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{index_usage_sec}{Usage}} of the tool for any prospective user.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
This software requires {\ttfamily libgd} and {\ttfamily gtk-\/2.\+0}. Ensure your system is up-\/to-\/date, and reference your Linux distribution to identify packages for installation.

E.\+g. On Ubuntu, you need to install the packages {\ttfamily libgd-\/dev} and {\ttfamily libgtk2.\+0-\/dev} through APT, while on Arch you need to install {\ttfamily gd} and {\ttfamily gtk2} through pacman.\hypertarget{index_usage_sec}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_usage_sec}
Once the source code and dependencies are installed, compile using the included Makefile included in {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}path/to/source\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/\+Project/\+Makefile}. After compilation, the tool can be used by executing the binary named \char`\"{}run\char`\"{}\+: {\ttfamily ./run}\hypertarget{index_cmds_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Commands}\label{index_cmds_sec}
For specific syntactic documentation, use the {\ttfamily menu} command within the tool.

This tool manipulates images through buffers. To load an image into a buffer, use the {\ttfamily read} command. Now that the image is in a buffer, this buffer can be manipulated (e.\+g. {\ttfamily brighten}, {\ttfamily fwht}, {\ttfamily flip}, etc.). Note that buffer content can be displayed at any time, without saving, using the {\ttfamily display} command.

Once the image has been manipulated as desired, the buffer can be saved into a file of type PNG,JPEG,TIFF,BMP through use of the {\ttfamily write} command.
